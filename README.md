# **Iran - Israel Cyber Attacks**
#### _A growing summery of Cyber Operations perpetrated by Iran against Israel._

- ### [2017 April. 19 - 24](https://blog.morphisec.com/iranian-fileless-cyberattack-on-israel-word-vulnerability) 
  > The Iranian APT group **OilRig** (aka APT34) targeted around 250 individuals in various sectors like government, high-tech, healthcare, education, and more.\
  The attack was delivered using word documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199, through compromised email accounts from the Ben-Gurion University.

- ### [2018 May](https://securelist.com/fanning-the-flames-viceleaker-operation/90877/)

  > Unknown Iranian threat actors suspected of attacking six water facilities in Israel. \
  According to [Western Officials](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-cyberattack-on-israels-water-supply-could-have-sickened-hundreds-report/), the hack aimed to raise Chlorin levels, a scenario that could've caused wide-scale water poisoning.

- ### [2021 May - July](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Siamesekitten.pdf)
  > An Iranian APT group named **SiameseKitten** (Hexane/Lyceum, sometimes confused with OilRig) conducted a Spear-Phishing campaign against Israeli IT and communication companies. \
  The attackers used fake job offers through LinkedIn, disguised as an HR department employee, and even established a fake Phishing website to impersonate the targeted organization.

- ### [2021 Sep](https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/mosesstaff-targeting-israeli-companies/)
  > The Iranian linked group **MosesStaff** carried out targeted attacks against Israeli companies using a legitimate encryption tool. \
  The main motive was to cause damage by leaking sensitive information, and encrypting the victims network without demanding ransom.

- ### [2021 Sep - 2022 Jun](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/sponsor-batch-filed-whiskers-ballistic-bobcats-scan-strike-backdoor/)
  > The Iranian espionage group **BallisticBobcat** (APT35) hacked various Israeli companies in multiple industries like automotive, communication, healthcare, finance and many more.\
  The attackers presumably exploited CVE-2021-26855 in Microsoft Exchange servers without specifically targeting victims.

- ### [2022 Feb](https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/check-point-research-exposes-an-iranian-phishing-campaign-targeting-former-israeli-foreign-minister-former-us-ambassador-idf-general-and-defense-industry-executives/)
  > Unknown Iranian hackers used spear-phishing attacks against high ranking Israeli officials. 
  The attackers were able to gain credibility by infiltrating into email conversation threads after hacking one of the correspondents.

- ### [2023 Feb](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/02/darkbit-ransomware-targets-israel)
  > The Iranian group **MuddyWater** are suspected to be behind the DarkBit Ransomware/Wiper Attacks on the Israeli Technion University.

- ### [2023 Sep. 21](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/oilrigs-outer-space-juicy-mix-same-ol-rig-new-drill-pipes/)
  > The Iranian APT group **OilRig** (aka APT34, sometimes mixed with SiameseKitten) operated cyber espionage campaigns exclusively against Israeli organizations.\
  Presumably spread via Spear-Phishing and was mainly intended to steal sensitive information.

- ### [2023 Oct. 10](https://securityscorecard.com/research/israel-ics-cri/)
  > An pro-Iranian low-sophistication hacktivist group named **SiegedSec**, claimed that it had conducted a series of DDoS attacks against Industrial Controllers for critical infrastructure.

- ### [2023 Oct. 19](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/crambus-middle-east-government) 
  > The Iranian **OilRig** cyber espionage group (aka APT34, Crambus) broke into computer networks in an unspecified country from the middle east (probably Israel, UAE or one of the other Gulf states) and collected data for 8 months. \
  The attackers collected sensitive information like passwords, files and even inspected USB packets.

- ### [2023 Oct. 28](https://www.securityjoes.com/post/mission-data-destruction-a-large-scale-data-wiping-campaign-targeting-israel)
  > The Iranian threat group **Moses Staff** Claimed in their [Telegram](https://t.me/moses_staff_se_17) channel that they have infiltrated and caused damage to Contel (an Israeli industrial automation company).\
  Apart from that they have also claimed to have hacked 20 other companies and leaked IDF reservists information.
  
- ### [2023 Oct. 30](https://www.securityjoes.com/post/bibi-linux-a-new-wiper-dropped-by-pro-hamas-hacktivist-group)
  > A destructive malware named BiBi Wiper was found attacking Linux computers (and [Windows](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1719437301900595444)) in an unspecified Israeli company.\
  The attack was done by a hacktivist group named Krama (linked to **Moses Staff**), politically motivated due to it's destructive nature, and multiple mentions of BiBi (The nickname of the Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu).

## General Summary
Iran has two known top-level agencies responsible for most of the cyber operations.

- **IRGC** (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). 
  - > Reports directly to the Iranian supreme leader (Ali Khamenei)
- **MOIS** (Ministry of Intelligence and Security (VEVAK in Farsi) 
  - > Reports to the president.

Both coordinate through the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.

The **IRGC** also contracts private companies like Emennet Pasargad (Cotton Sandstorm), 
Afkar Systems, Najee Technologies (Nemesis Kitten/APT35 Cluster), and more.\
Some of the prominent targets are Israel, the United States, Gulf states like the United Arab Emirates, 
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Iranian political adversaries.

Iranian cyber operations vary from Ransomware, Defacement, Sabotage (DOS/Wipers), espionage, theft and gaining illicit profit, 
to manipulation and influence campaigns, aka Cyber-Enabled Influence Operations (IOs). 

The influence campaigns include themes like Palestinian resistance, Shi'ite unrest in the Gulf, counter-Arab-Israeli normalization and economic relations, 
cause panic/fear among Israelis, political manipulations in the US, 
and exposing corrupt or embarrassing activities of Iranian adversaries.
