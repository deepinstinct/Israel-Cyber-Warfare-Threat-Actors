## General Summary
Iran has two known top-level agencies responsible for most of the cyber operations.

- **IRGC** (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). 
  - > Reports directly to the Iranian supreme leader (Ali Khamenei)
- **MOIS** (Ministry of Intelligence and Security (VEVAK in Farsi) 
  - > Reports to the president.

Both coordinate through the Supreme Council of Cyberspace.

The **IRGC** also contracts private companies like Emennet Pasargad (Cotton Sandstorm), 
Afkar Systems, Najee Technologies (Nemesis Kitten/APT35 Cluster), and more.\
Some of the prominent targets are Israel, the United States, Gulf states like the United Arab Emirates, 
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Iranian political adversaries.

Iranian cyber operations vary from Ransomware, Defacement, Sabotage (DOS/Wipers), espionage, theft and gaining illicit profit, 
to manipulation and influence campaigns, aka Cyber-Enabled Influence Operations (IOs). 

The influence campaigns include themes like Palestinian resistance, Shi'ite unrest in the Gulf, counter-Arab-Israeli normalization and economic relations, 
cause panic/fear among Israelis, political manipulations in the US, 
and exposing corrupt or embarrassing activities of Iranian adversaries.
